Wix joins other great & well established companies like Microsoft, Google, IBM and more that understands that Open-Source has a key role in the tech landscape.
Wix supports both established OSS projects (Libraries that are used internally) and non-established OSS projects (Libraries that are not directly used or rarely used internally) in their daily approach towards OSS.
Established projects gets more attention and resources - Actively Managing their Discord communities, and assign internal resources upfront to maintain the projects, whereas non-established projects are being handled on a spare-time, guild-week / contribution days basis.



## Wix actively contributing to the Open-Source realm in several ways:

To decide which libraries are the most used and contributed the most to the SW guilds, It conducted a survey that was spread over the entire company and requested a suggestion of libraries and have a vote for the libraries who contributed the most, according to the voters. Then, once the 8 libraries were selected - It started sponsoring them.

2. Projects Public Releases - It releases a lot of projects and useful pieces of code as OSS (you can see them in this [link](https://github.com/wix)) and 
there are Software Developers at Wix that are assigned to maintain these projects on a daily basis to make sure they follow the Incubator standards.
